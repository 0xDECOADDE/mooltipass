Mooltipass Random Number Generation description
===============================================

1- AVR-ARDUINO ENTROPY LIBRARY
------------------------------
The Entropy project is a library that will run on many 8-bit AVRs either standalone or within an Arduino environment, that make use of the watchdog timer's natural jitter to produce a reliable stream of true random numbers. Unlike other methods currently available, this library requires no external hardware and produces a considerably more random number stream than methods based upon the technique of reading an unconnected analog pin. 

In order to generate random numbers, we have modified the arduino C++ library to a C library.

A link to download the original library can be found here: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/avr-hardware-random-number-generation/wiki/WikiAVRentropy"> Arduino AVR entropy library </a>


2- USING THE LIBRARY
--------------------
How to use the library? how to work  with it ?

We only have to remember about three functions.

```
void EntropyInit(void); // Init the timer0 and the watchdog interrupt (each 16ms)
uint8_t EntropyRandom8(void); // Get a byte from the entropy pool
uint8_t EntropyBytesAvailable(void); // Check how many bytes are available
```

3- TESTING THE LIBRARY
----------------------
We have checked the library performance generating 1 milion of bytes. The bytes were sent to USB serial port and saved by CUTECOM into a binary file.

Sample code to generate 1 milion random bytes:
```
uint32_t ranomNumCtr;

// init avrentropy library
EntropyInit();

for(randomNumCtr=0; randomNumCtr<1000000; randomNumCtr++)
{
        usb_serial_putchar(EntropyRandom8());
}
```

To get the statistics of the binary file we have used the ENT utility <a href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/random/"> ENT Utility </a>. The Fourmilab ENT program is a public domain utility which tests binary data sequences, either as a series of 8 bit bytes, or as a bit stream, with five standard tests for randomness. The output of the ENT utility with the 1 milion binary file is:

```
Entropy = 7.999798 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 1000000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 1000000 samples is 280.78, and randomly
would exceed this value 12.83 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.5040 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.141924568 (error 0.01 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.000566 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
```

It took 2 days to generate 1000000 milion bytes.
