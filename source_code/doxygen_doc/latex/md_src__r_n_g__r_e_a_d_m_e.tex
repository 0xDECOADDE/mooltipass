The Entropy project is a library that will run on many 8-\/bit A\+V\+Rs either standalone or within an Arduino environment, that make use of the watchdog timer's natural jitter to produce a reliable stream of true random numbers. Unlike other methods currently available, this library requires no external hardware and produces a considerably more random number stream than methods based upon the technique of reading an unconnected analog pin.

In order to generate random numbers, we have modified the arduino C++ library to a C library.

A link to download the original library can be found here\+: \href{http://code.google.com/p/avr-hardware-random-number-generation/wiki/WikiAVRentropy}{\tt Arduino A\+V\+R entropy library }

How to use the library? how to work with it ?

We only have to remember about three functions.

``` void Entropy\+Init(void); // Init the timer0 and the watchdog interrupt (each 16ms) uint8\+\_\+t Entropy\+Random8(void); // Get a byte from the entropy pool uint8\+\_\+t Entropy\+Bytes\+Available(void); // Check how many bytes are available ```

\subsection*{3-\/ T\+E\+S\+T\+I\+N\+G T\+H\+E L\+I\+B\+R\+A\+R\+Y }

We have checked the library performance generating 1 milion of bytes. The bytes were sent to U\+S\+B serial port and saved by C\+U\+T\+E\+C\+O\+M into a binary file.

Sample code to generate 1 milion random bytes\+: ``` uint32\+\_\+t ranom\+Num\+Ctr;

// init avrentropy library Entropy\+Init();

for(random\+Num\+Ctr=0; random\+Num\+Ctr$<$1000000; random\+Num\+Ctr++) \{ usb\+\_\+serial\+\_\+putchar(\+Entropy\+Random8()); \} ```

To get the statistics of the binary file we have used the \href{http://www.fourmilab.ch/random/}{\tt E\+N\+T Utility }. The Fourmilab E\+N\+T program is a public domain utility which tests binary data sequences, either as a series of 8 bit bytes, or as a bit stream, with five standard tests for randomness. The output of the E\+N\+T utility with the 1 milion binary file is\+:

``` Entropy = 7.\+999798 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size of this 1000000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 1000000 samples is 280.\+78, and randomly would exceed this value 12.\+83 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.\+5040 (127.\+5 = random). Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.\+141924568 (error 0.\+01 percent). Serial correlation coefficient is 0.\+000566 (totally uncorrelated = 0.\+0). ```

It took 2 days to generate 1 milion bytes.
